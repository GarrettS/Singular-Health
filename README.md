# Singular Health
Decentralized Patient-Managed Health and Healthcare Marketplace

## Thesis: 
Patient health belongs to the patient. Doctors are service providers, not authorities, not managers of patients. 


## Problems: 
* Patients don't have ready access to their health records but they need it.

* Health records management is difficult and expensive for providers. 

* Referrals are inconvenient for providers and patients. 

* Medical records are transmitted insecurely. Providers and patients usually prefer the patient to send information via email, in violation of HIPAA. 

* Maintaining copies of diagnostics, referrals, notes, prescriptions, and other records is inconvenient and lossy. 

* Medical practice management and healthcare administration is expensive. This increases cost and reduces profit.

* Changes in insurance coverage, provider networks, or providers make all of the above harder, unnecessarily.

* Schedules are hard to adhere to. Patients and doctors are frequently late.

* Submitting insurance claims is annoying.

* Finding available providers matching a location and insurance coverage is hard.
 
## Synopsis: 
Let patients manage their own records with the app. Patients can also inquire and share records and share media (photos, videos, files) with new or existing providers. Let physicians communicate and schedule directly with patients through the app, bypassing unskilled medical office staff. Eliminate billing with automatic contractual payments.

### Expected impact:
Reduced cost of practice for physicians. Decreased cost of starting for medical practitioners leading to increased number of private practices and more innovative, emerging healthcare solutions to reach more people.

Improved quality of care, better health, and better quality of life, worldwide.
