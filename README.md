# Singular-Health
Health Records Management Platform

Singular Health

Thesis: Patient health belongs to the patient. Doctors are service providers, not authorities. 



Problem: 
* Health records management is difficult and expensive for providers. 

* The referral process is inconvenient for providers and patients. 

* Maintaining copies of diagnostics, referrals, and prescriptions is inconvenient and lossy. 

* Medical practice management and healthcare administration is expensive. This increases cost and reduces profit.

* Changes in insurance coverage, provider networks, or providers make all of the above harder, unnecessarily.

* Schedules are hard to adhere to. Patients and doctors are frequently late.
