# Singular Health
Health and Healthcare Marketplace for Patients and Providers
 
<sub>Copyright 2018 Garrett Smith</sub>

## Summary: 
Patient health belongs to the patient. Doctors are service providers, not authorities, not managers of patients. Doctors are professionals, not servants of managed health organizations.

## Patient problems: 
* Patients don't have ready access to their health records but they need it.
* Medical records are sometimes transmitted insecurely, via email or SMS, in violation of HIPAA. 
* Maintaining copies of diagnostics, referrals, notes, prescriptions, and other records is inconvenient and lossy.
* Referrals and continuity of care are inconvenient and lossy. 
* Submitting insurance claims is annoying.
* Finding updated available providers matching location and insurance coverage is hard.

## Provider problems: 
* Records lack diet, supplementation, and lifestyle data.
* Health records management is difficult and expensive for providers. 
* Medical practice management and healthcare administration is difficult, expensive, and insufficient[1][2]. 
* Changes in insurance coverage, provider networks, or providers make all of the above harder, unnecessarily.
* Schedules are hard to maintain. Patients cancel or no-show and doctors are frequently late.
 
## Solution Synopsis: 
Patients manage their own records with the app. Patients can search for providers by availability, distance, speciality, and insurance, and other criteria. Patients contact providers for scheduling. Patients share select records and media (photos, videos, files) with new or existing providers. Patients update PHI (diet, exercise, supplements) and biometric data (sleep and blood sugar trackers, etc).

Providers communicate and schedule directly with patients through the app, reducing or bypassing office staff. Contractual payments can reduce billing costs.

### Expected impact:
Reduced cost of practice for physicians. Decreased cost of starting for medical practitioners leading to increased number of private practices and more innovative, emerging healthcare solutions to reach more people.

Improved quality of care, better health, and better quality of life, worldwide. Worldwide healthcare marketplace expected to be significantly impacted as providers will be able to assist those in third world countries. Countries that can provide competitive pricing have access to first world country marketplace and money. 

Existing competing applications include B10S and OneRecord.
